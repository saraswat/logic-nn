	Annote = {Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction. These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.},

In our algorithm, the ownership of a variable is asynchronously transferred between processors in a decentralized fashion. Due to its lock-free and asynchronous nature, NOMAD outperforms synchronous algorithms which require explicit bulk synchronization after every iteration: our extensive empirical evaluation shows that not only does our algorithm perform well in distributed setting on commodity hardware, but also outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on a HPC cluster both in multi-core and distributed memory settings.}},

  abstract = { With the increasing reliance on game theory as a foundation for auctions
	and electronic commerce, efficient algorithms for computing equilibria
	in multiplayer general-sum games are of great theoretical and practical
	interest. The computational complexity of finding a Nash equilibrium
	for a one-shot bimatrix game is a well known open problem. This paper
	treats a related but distinct problem, that of finding a Nash equilibrium
	for an average-payoff repeated bimatrix game, and presents a polynomial-time
	algorithm. Our approach draws on the well known ``folk theorem''
	from game theory and shows how finite-state equilibrium strategies
	can be found efficiently and expressed succinctly. }

	model of a power-managed system. The system model is composed of
	the corresponding stochastic models of the service queue and the
	service provider. The system environment is modeled by a stochastic
	service request process. The problem of dynamic power management
	in such a system is formulated as a policy optimization problem and
	solved using an efficient 'policy iteration' algorithm. Compared
	to previous work on dynamic power management, our formulation allows
	better modeling of the various system components, the power-managed
	system as a whole, and its environment. In addition it captures dependencies
	between the service queue and service provider status. Finally, the
	resulting power management policy is asynchronous, hence it is more
	power-efficient and more useful in practice. Experimental results
	demonstrate the effectiveness of our policy optimization algorithm
	compared to a number of heuristic (time-out and Npol...}

	of the representational components of a training image ensemble,
	but it cannot distinguish between the different factors, or modes,
	inherent to image formation, including scene structure, illumination,
	and imaging. We introduce a nonlinear, multifactor model that generalizes
	ICA. Our multilinear ICA (MICA) model of image ensembles learns the
	statistically independent components of multiple factors. Whereas
	ICA employs linear (matrix) algebra, MICA exploits multilinear (tensor)
	algebra. We furthermore introduce a multilinear projection algorithm
	which projects an unlabeled test image into the N constituent mode
	spaces to simultaneously infer its mode labels. In the context of
	facial image ensembles, where the mode labels are person, viewpoint,
	illumination, expression, etc., we demonstrate that the statistical
	regularities learned by MICA capture information that, in conjunction

	Abstract = {Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction. These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.},
